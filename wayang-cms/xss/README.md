`$_SESSION['visitor']` is assigned as an array, `$_SESSION['visitor']['visitorip']` is the visitor IP, its calling method is ip(), locate this method, the file is `wy_get_ipaddress .php`.

Here, the source IP can be forged by `X-Forwarded-For`, this method returns directly without any processing of the data, and then assigns it to `$_SESSION['visitor']`, and finally outputs directly to form a reflective XSS.
PayLoad: `X-Forwarded-For: <script>alert('xss')</script>`
